People who use Linux know that copy/paste is as easy as selecting
some text and then clicking the middle mouse button to put that
text exactly where you want it. No need to navigate your poor and
addled with carpel-tunnel left hand all the way over to the
Ctrl-C/Ctrl-V combination, saving precious calories. 

I used to use
this trick in Firefox also. If you highlighted a URL, you could
just hover in the window and middle click in there, and it would
take you to the page. This was nice, because if you tried to copy
it into the address bar, it would keep the original address in
there, and then you would have to backspace it out, blah blah. 

For
some reason, the newer versions of Firefox seem to have this
disabled (I think, unless I disabled it in some stupid way, which
is completely possible). To enable it, navigate to
[about:config](about:config "about:config"). This will take you to
the secret preferences of Firefox. There, you can set the
middlemouse.contentLoadURL to 'true', and get that setting back.


Another one that I like is using Ctrl-Backspace to delete parts of
a URL in the address bar. It works great on my windows side, but in
Linux, it just deletes the entire bar. To get that setting back, I
had to set layout.word\_select.stop\_at\_punctuation to 'true'. 

The
about:config has all kinds of settings in there that can help you
if you poke around in there.
