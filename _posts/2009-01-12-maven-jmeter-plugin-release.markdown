WOW what a long day since my last post! IT WAS ONE DAY I SWEAR.
Anyway, I put up an information page for the maven-jmeter-plugin up
[here](http://www.ronniealleva.org/index.php/maven-jmeter-plugin/).

I also set up a google code project
[here](http://code.google.com/p/jmeter-maven-plugin/) for it. 
Please let me know if you have any features or feedback on it.

Thanks!
