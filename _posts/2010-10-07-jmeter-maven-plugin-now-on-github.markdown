Wow, I've gotten a lot of requests for the jmeter-maven-plugin, for
enhancements and whatnot. I originally had the code on
code.google.com, but from there I have to add contributors, blah
blah blah. So I moved all the code over to github, so if anybody
wants to update it, now they can do so directly, through github.
The page for the jmeter plugin is still
[here](http://www.ronniealleva.org/index.php/maven-jmeter-plugin/).
