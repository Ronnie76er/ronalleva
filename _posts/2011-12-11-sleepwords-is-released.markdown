title: Sleepwords is released!
---

I finally got around to releasing my silly little app for Android.  It's called "Sleepwords", and it floats the name of random objects in front of you, to help you sleep, meditate, or give your conscience mind a distraction to help your subconscience mind flow free.  Best of all, IT'S FREE.  So you really have no excuse not to at least try it.

You can find it [on the market here.](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.alleva&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5hbGxldmEiXQ..) I'm planning on making the source code available soon.
